==1.5 beta2==
- FIX: ADF with some scanners was not working (thanks to cmumathwhiz)
- FIX: Some minor stability fixes

==1.5 beta1==
- ADD: Logging for troubleshooting purposes. iCopy will save a .log file either in its folder or in %AppData%\Local\iCopy
- IMPROVED: Revised command line parameters. See README.txt for information or type iCopy.exe /help
- FIX: Scanner handling has been revised, now it's more robust. Should avoid problems when scanning a second page
- FIX: Fixed a regression in version 1.49 that resulted in an error during the acquisition
- FIX: Some scanners (eg. CanoScan 4400F) acquire only a quarter of the page (bad handling of WIA_IPS_XEXTENT & WIA_IPS_YEXTENT)
- FIX: Some scanners (eg. CanoScan 4400F) not supporting WIA_IPS_CUR_INTENT property (which should be required) acquire only in black and white mode

== 1.49 ==
- FIX: iCopy crashes (or throws exception) when doing a second scan on certain configurations - THANKS to D. Forester for this fix

== 1.48 ==
- ADD: 	Possibility to choose the bit depth of the acquired page.

- FIX: 	Fixed a bug that prevented iCopy to save settings if the directory is protected (default behavior in Vista and 7)
		If iCopy does not have permissions to write in its execution directory, 
		the file will be saved in the user's settings directory (eg C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\iCopy).
